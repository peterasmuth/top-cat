# Bike Share App

Right now this app consists of a basic UI, and an implementation of the Room Persistence Library (Room). From the Android docs: "The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite"

Using Room, I've created a couple tables (entities), one for users, and one for bikes. These entities are defined in User.java and Bike.java. I've also created corresponding data access objects (Daos) for each entity.

Currently, I'm working on improving the UI, and its interaction with the Room database. I'm also looking to implement Google Maps in a meaningful way.
