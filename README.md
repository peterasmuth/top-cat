# Bike Share App

Big Messy To-Do List:

1) Add a Google Maps activity that can show the locations of all the "bikes" in the area.

-The "bikes" can just be a list of coordinate pairs that get marked on the map.

-Make the map camera center on the location of the user.

2) Implement SQL database to store all the app data

-I've started working with MSSQL, but none of that appears in this repo

-Investigate .NET web service to interface Android and MSSQL

3) In AddBike activity, pull text from the input fields to form a SQL command (or something)

4) Make the UI look less horrible
